        <h3>Description</h2>
        <p>Carnitas (which means "little meats" in Spanish) is a Mexican dish. 
            It consists of pork that is simmered or braised with seasonings and fat until it’s tender enough to be shredded. 
            The shredded meat is then roasted until it’s brown and crispy. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 pounds pork shoulder, chopped into large pieces</li>

            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>

            <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. 
                Season pork shoulder pieces with salt, and then arrange in the Dutch oven.

                Pour in chicken broth, bring to a boil.

            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid.

            <li>Bake pork in the oven until browned, about 30 minutes.
                Drizzle more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred as it browns.</li>
